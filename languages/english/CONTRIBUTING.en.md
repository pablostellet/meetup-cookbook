# How to contribute to PUG-PE Meetup Cookbook?

First, thank you so much for thinking about contributing! :smile::smile:

This document presents a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These guidelines aren't exactly rules, but following them helps everyone to be on the same page. Feel free to submit a *pull request* for this document. In general, use common sense.

## Code of conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are subjected to the [code of conduct](https://python.org.br/cdc/). By participating you are expected to be following it as well.

## How can I contribute?

### Sugesting improvements

Before suggesting, please make sure the same idea has not been suggested before (sometimes you won't need to create a new suggestion).

#### How to submit a good improvement suggestion?

Improvements are presented as [*Github Issues*](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**;
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggestion**;
- **Explain why this improvement is useful**;
- **Describe a *before and after*, if applicable**;
- **Provide examples, if applicable**.

### Creating *Pull Requests*

Please follow the steps below to evaluate your contribution:

1. Follow the instructions for the *pull requests* template when creating;
2. Follow the [*style guides*](#guias-de-estilo);


Even if the above prerequisites are followed, this does not mean that project maintainers cannot request additions to the *pull request*, clarification of information, changes to some sections, etc., before the contribution is accepted.

## Style guides

### *commit* messages of git

- Use Affirmative Imperative on second person ("Add Contribution Guides ..." not "Adding Contribution Guides ...")
- Title (first line) must be 50 characters or less
    - Write objective *commit* message about what that commit changes in the project.
    - Try to answer "What does this *commit* do?";
- If *commit* is described, leave the second line blank;
- Add a description to the commit beginning from the third line, with 72 characters or less per line;
    - When asking yourself if a description is required for *commit*, ask yourself if anyone wants to investigate "why this change has been introduced" will only be possible by the title and content of *commit*;
- Refer to *issues* or *pull requests* at the end of the message;

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
